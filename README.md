📊 Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard
A concise and dynamic business intelligence project developed to track, analyze, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) of a sales organization's operations and financial health.

🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard offers a high-level overview of sales trends, revenue generation, and customer acquisition metrics. The primary purpose is to enable sales managers and executives to monitor performance in near real-time, identify top-performing regions and products, and quickly spot anomalies or areas requiring strategic intervention to maximize revenue and efficiency.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – The primary platform used for data modeling, visualization design, and report creation.

📂 Power Query (M Language) – Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation (e.g., handling date tables, currency conversion, and joining sales data).

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Employed for creating calculated measures and advanced business logic, such as Month-over-Month Growth, Forecast vs. Actual, and Weighted Pipeline Value.

📝 Data Modeling – Established relationships between sales transactions, product catalogs, and customer data to ensure accurate and flexible analysis.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

💾 Data Source
The project uses a structured data source typical of sales reporting.

Source: Mock/Practice Sales Data Set from E-commerce or CRM System (Hypothetical)

Data Content: The dataset is assumed to contain detailed sales records, including fields such as:

Revenue Metrics: Sales Amount, Cost of Goods Sold, Profit.

The dashboard's primary objective is to drive data-informed decision-making in the sales process.

Business Problem: Sales data is often siloed or too granular for quick, executive-level insights, leading to slow reactions to market changes or missed opportunities to motivate sales teams.

Goal of the Dashboard: To consolidate complex transactional data into a few high-impact pages, facilitating immediate performance assessment and deep-dive root cause analysis.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Highlighting total Revenue, Total Units Sold, and Average Deal Size for the period selected via slicers.

Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart): Visualizing monthly or quarterly revenue trends with a comparison against the prior year or a set target.

Top 10 Products by Revenue (Bar Chart): Ranking the best-selling products to focus marketing and inventory efforts.

Geographic Performance (Map Visual): Showing sales distribution across different countries/regions to identify markets for expansion or consolidation.

Sales Rep Leaderboard (Table): A dynamic table ranking sales representatives by revenue and units sold, often including key metrics like average close rate.

Business Impact & Insights
